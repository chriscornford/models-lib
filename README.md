Supporting code and tooling for OpenActive models, common across all languages

OpenActive aims to support implementers with models written in [PHP](https://github.com/openactive/models-php), [Ruby](https://github.com/openactive/models-ruby), and [.NET](https://github.com/openactive/OpenActive.NET). This repository is intended to hold resources (e.g. generators, tests) shared across all of the above.
